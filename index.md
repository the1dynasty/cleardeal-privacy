# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** January 13, 2026

## 1. Introduction
**ClearDeal** ("we," "our," or "us") respects the privacy of our users ("user" or "you"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application (the "Application"). 

Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the application.

## 2. Collection of Information
We collect minimal data to provide the Application's functionality.

### Personal Data
We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, address, or phone number. We do not require account registration to use the Application.

### Financial Data
The vehicle price, lease terms, trade-in values, and finance rates you enter are stored **locally on your device** using your device’s native storage protocols (Shared Preferences). We do not transmit this data to any external database or cloud server.

### Device Data (Bug Reporting)
If you voluntarily use the **"Report a Bug"** or **"Shake to Report"** feature, the Application will capture and send specific technical data to us to help diagnose the issue. This data is sent via a secure third-party email API (EmailJS) and includes:
* **Device Information:** Manufacturer, Model, and Operating System version (e.g., Pixel 8 Pro, Android 14).
* **Application Information:** App Version and Build Number.
* **Application Logs:** A history of recent non-identifiable actions taken within the app (e.g., "User calculated lease", "Tab switched").
* **Screenshot:** A capture of your screen at the moment of the report. This is only captured and sent if you explicitly confirm the action in the "Report a Bug" dialog.

## 3. Use of Your Information
We use the information we collect strictly to:
* Perform the automotive finance and lease calculations requested by you.
* Persist your user preferences (e.g., Default Tax Rate, Dealer Fee) locally on your device for your convenience.
* Diagnose technical issues and improve the stability of the Application (via voluntarily submitted bug reports).

## 4. Disclosure of Your Information
We do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise share your information with third parties for marketing purposes.

**Third-Party Service Providers:**
We may use third-party services solely for the purpose of operational functionality:
* **EmailJS:** Used to transmit the bug reports and feedback you voluntarily submit.

## 5. Data Security
Your financial inputs and saved quotes are stored locally on your device. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, please be aware that no method of electronic storage or transmission over the internet is 100% secure.

## 6. Children’s Privacy
We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information immediately.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. Changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
